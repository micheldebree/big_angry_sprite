                                                   
come with me if you want to live                                        
this big angry sprite was coded for raistlin's "only sprites compo", but didn't quite make the deadline. 
i am very glad anyway because it's been 30 years since i coded anything on the c64, and i 
almost forgot how much fun and how addictive it is to be coding so close to the metal! 
this is also a reference to one of the last things i coded on c64: the "split personality" part in 
the demo "before you go", made in 1990. 
greetings go to genius, laxity, jch, reyn, sander, moren, mace, stratford, burglar, scoosie and all my fellow heatwavers. 
special thanks to laxity and jch for the excellent sidfactory 2, and for (p)reviewing my tunes. 
if you want to swap, send a floppy with the latest warez to the address on the disk cover (no lamerz!). 
and don't forget to hairspray the stamp so i can send it back to you! 
                                 hugs and kisses - youth
